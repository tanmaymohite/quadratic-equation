#Quadratic Equation-Formula method 
<hr>

In algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation that can be rearranged in standard form as
 
```ax^{2}+bx+c=0}ax^{2}+bx+c=0``` 

where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers, where a â‰  0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic, as there is no {\displaystyle ax^{2}}ax^2 term. The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.[more](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation)
